# SmartContract_Event
A smart contract that facilitates artists to bridge the gap in commercializing their skills.
Organizing events and workshops requires middlemen, that means less revenue for the artists and often leads to a not so transparent system. A smart contract could help the artists be on the driver's seat and provide a structured and decentralized way to make more profit.

Event smart contract has been developed using solidity coding language. It has structures such as Artist, Venue, Sponsor, PublicityManager and Partcipant. It helps account holders to take part and register as these structures. It further lets creator of the event to choose accounts for roles, for which they have registered.
